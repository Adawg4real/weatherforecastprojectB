Welcome to Adrianna's awesome recipes!! This project is to create a recipe book that lets you add, remove, modify, and search through a cook book.
ADD - when you add a recipe you can add the ingredients and instructions as well as an image or a name.
REMOVE - when you click this button a dialogue box will appear asking you whether or not you want to delete the recipe you've clicked
MODIFY - when this is clicked you will be taken to a form where you can edit the existing recipe. You can change the image, name, or instructions
SEARCH - this is displayed on the main page and will show recipes that contain the text that you've written, otherwise it will print that no recipes were found

This sums up what the end goal of what I wanted this project to be.
